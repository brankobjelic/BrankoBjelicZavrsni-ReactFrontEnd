# BrankoBjelicZavrsni-ReactFrontEnd
 Front End made with ReactJS library.
After finishing .NET Development Course, where final test consisted of making ASP.NET Web Api REST API on back end, and Vanilla Javascript application on front end to consume it, I decided to start learning React. My first project is this front end for the same API. It's functional but needs adding form fields validation and CSS.
